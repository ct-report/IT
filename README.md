Contact Tracing - Italy

On April 16, the COVID-19 emergency commissioner has declared **IMMUNI** - developed by Bending Spoons - as the official app of the Italian Government.

On April 22, it has been announced that IMMUNI would no longer use a centralized model (PEPP-PT), but instead a decentralized one (DP ^ 3T based) together with the new Apple + Google Exposure Notification (BLE Contact Tracing) API. The release of such Apple+Google API to developers is scheduled for April 28.
